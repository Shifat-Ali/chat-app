# Chat-WebApp

## Description
Welcome to my project! This is realtime multiuser char webapp made using React and Express. It allows user to chat with each other in realtime just like any other commercially available messaging app. I have used react because of it's component base rendering which is just what i was looking for my project. My project is currently not Bug free, so if anyone is willing for contributing to my project, they are most welcomed. I hope you will enjoy using it and looking forward for contributions!!
